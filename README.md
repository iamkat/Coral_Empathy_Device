# Coral_Empathy_Device
The coral empathy device is a wearable piece of technology that aims to create emapthy between humans and the marine environment by translating the experience of a coral under the influence of anthropogenic sounds and chemical stimulae, into something similarly meaningful for a human in their own environment.

The current version of the device is being made in Shanghai NYU PCI during a residency. The aim is to build a speaker from a thin metal globe (possibly aluminium) by using copper coils and magnets. The bottom of the globe has been cut off and the viewer puts their head inside to experience the device. This is working but I need to make the coils longer and increase the volume of the recording. I'm also aiming to use a motor running off the same mp3 that will play through the coil to drive a motor to move fabric within the globe. This is not working currently.
