# Coral_Empathy_Device
The coral empathy device is a wearable piece of technology that aims to create emapthy between humans and the marine environment by translating the experience of a coral under the influence of anthropogenic sounds and chemical stimulae, into something similarly meaningful for a human in their own environment.

A video of the prototype can be found here https://vimeo.com/146943535

The current version of the device was  made in Shanghai NYU PCI during a residency in collaboration with Shanghai NYU Gallery. The device turns a thin metal globe (possibly aluminium) into  a speaker by using copper coils and magnets, a process developed in collaboration with Kasia Justka at MonoShop Berlin https://www.facebook.com/Mono-Shop-628841883927078/.

The bottom of the globe was  cut off and the viewer puts their head inside to experience the device. After much troubleshooting, this is working along with a motor running off the same mp3 that moves fabric within the globe.
